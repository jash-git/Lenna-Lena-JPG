<h2>Introduction</h2>
<img src="./Lenna 97_ A Complete Story of Lenna_files/len_std.jpg" border="0" height="168" width="168" align="RIGHT" alt="Lenna Picture">
<p>Engineers, researchers, and students who are familiar with image processing
or compression has most likely used the picture of "Lenna" or "Lena" in their
experiments or project assignments, as the Lenna picture is one of the most
widely used standard test images.  Today, the use of Lenna image has been
recognized as one of the most important events in the history of electronic
imaging. However, very few people have seen the original picture and know
the complete story of Lenna. Here is the materials about Lenna I have
recently found on the Internet, which includes the recent picture of Lenna in
May 1997.
</p><p>

</p><h2>Who is "Lenna" or "Lena"?</h2>
<p>
From the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/compression-faq/part1/section-29.html">comp.compression FAQ</a>, we can find that "Lenna" or "Lena" is a digitized Playboy centerfold, from November 1972.  
Lenna is the spelling in Playboy, Lena is the Swedish spelling of her name. 
(In English, Lena is sometimes spelled Lenna, to encourage proper pronounciation.) 
Lena Soderberg (ne Sjooblom) was last reported living in her native Sweden, happily married with three kids and a job with the state liquor monopoly. In 1988, she was interviewed by some Swedish computer related publication, and she 
was pleasantly amused by what had happened to her picture. That was the first she knew of the use of that picture in the computer business. </p>
<p>
</p><h2>When and where the Lenna picture creates?</h2>
<p>
In the <a href="http://www.playboy.com/news/lena/lena.html">Playboy</a> and 
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/story/4000.html">Wired News</a>, 
we know that in the early Seventies Lenna's Playboy centerfold was scanned 
in by an unknown researcher at the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a> 
to use as a test image for digital image compression research.  Since that time, 
images of the Playmate have been used as the industry standard for testing ways 
in which pictures can be manipulated and transmitted electronically. Over the 
past 25 years, no image has been more important in the history of imaging and 
electronic communications, and today the mysterious Lenna is considered the First 
Lady of the Internet.

</p><p>
</p><h2>Why using the "Lenna" image?</h2>
<p>
Two reason was stated in "<a href="http://www.nofiles.de/roots/lena/lenanote.html">A Note on Lena</a>"
by David C. Munson. 
First, the Lenna image contains a nice mixture of detail, flat regions, shading, and texture that do a good job 
of testing various image processing algorithms. It is a good test image! 
Second, the Lena image is a picture of an attractive woman. It is not surprising that the (mostly male) 
image processing research community gravitated toward an image that they found attractive. 
</p><p>
</p><h2>Who create the "Lenna" image?</h2>
<p>
In October 29, 1999, I received an email from Chuck McNanis telling us that the "unknown researcher" who scanned the "Lenna" image was Dr. William K. Pratt. Here is the email:

</p><p>
I worked for 5 years ('78 - '83) at the Image Processing Institute as a 
 system programmer in the Image Processing Lab (IPL) which distributed 
 Lenna and several other images (including the Mandril) which people 
 often refer to as "The baboon image." The "unknown researcher" was Dr.

 William K. Pratt, now of Sun Microsystems, who was writing a book on 
 image processing and he needed some standard images for it. For a long 
 time the folded up centerfold that had been the basis for that image was 
 in the file cabinet at the lab. I went back in 1997 to visit and the lab 
 has undergone many changes and the original image files were nowhere
 to 
 be found. The original distribution format was 1600BPI 9-track tape with

 each color plane stored separately.

</p><h2>Want to see the original Lenna?</h2>
<p>
The standard digital Lenna image is just a closeup of the original picture with 
her face and bare shoulder.  Recently, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/lenna.shtml">Chuck Rosenberg</a> 
obtained a copy of the original Playboy Magazine and put it on the Internet.  Here's a glimpse:

<p>
</p><h2>Want to see the Lenna in 1997?</h2>
<p>
No problem!  Lenna was invited to attend the 50th Anniversary 
<a href="http://www.imaging.org/">IS&amp;T</a> conference in Boston on 
May 1997.  With the assistance of Playboy, 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/lenna_visit.html">Jeff Seideman</a> 
(the president of the Boston chapter of the IS&amp;T) arranged Lenna to appear at 
the IS&amp;T Boston, as part of an overview of the history of digital imaging.  
</p><p>
Here is a picture of Lenna taken in May 1997 at the IS&amp;T's 
conference:

<p>
At the conference, she was busy signing autographs, posing for pictures, 
and giving a presentation about herself.  Lenna commented to the 
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/story/4000.html">Wired</a>  
reporter: "They must be so tired of me ... looking at the same picture 
for all these years!"
</p><p>
Currently, Lenna lives near Stockholm and works for a government agency supervising 
handicapped employees archiving data using, appropriately, computers and scanners.
</p><p>

</p><h2>Where can I find the standard Lenna picture?</h2>

<p>
The standard version of Lenna is also available on a lot of ftp sites, detail can be found in the 
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/compression-faq/part1/section-29.html">comp.compression FAQ</a>.  
In addition, you can also obtain the Lenna image from the 
<a href="http://sipi.usc.edu/services/database/Misc.html">Miscellaneous volume</a> 
of the <a href="http://sipi.usc.edu/services/database/Database.html">USC-SIPI image database</a>, 
which costs $100 for distribution on 8mm or 4mm tape.  
The ordering details can be found in <a href="http://sipi.usc.edu/">Signal and Image Processing Institute</a> 
of the University of Southern California.
</p><p>
</p><h2>We may have a new standard Lenna image?</h2>

As mentioned by Seideman in <a href="http://www.playboy.com/news/lena/lena.html">Playboy Newsdesk</a>, 
over the years some researchers have complained that they lacked vital information 
about the Lenna image, such as what type of scanner was originally used, what 
kind of camera and film. He says that he is working with Playboy's archivist 
to re-scan Lenna's image and compile all the missing information, including 
everything from the type of photo emulsion used to make the print to the 
technical specifications of the scanner. In this way, Seideman says, the 
image of this Playboy Playmate can remain the standard reference image for 
comparing compression technologies into the 21st century.

</p><h2>Where can I find compression research using Lenna?</h2>
<p>
If you are a student, you may be interested in doing image compression 
research after knowing the Lenna story. 
In the nineties, wavelet is one of the hottest topics in image compression research.  
A very good web page that listed the results of the most recent 
wavelet image coding techniques using Lenna as the test image is published in 
<a href="http://icsl.ucla.edu/~ipl/psnr_results.html">Image Communication Lab</a> of UCLA.  
In the <a href="http://ipl.rpi.edu/SPIHT/">SPIHT</a> (Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees) site, demonstration images
and software are provided for the Said &amp; Pearlman algorithm. This is one of the most impressive image compression
algorithms in terms of performance/bit rate/complexity tradeoffs. 
A <a href="http://vail.ece.arizona.edu/~kasner/Lenna.html">Lenna Results Page</a> is also 
availalbe on the Internet, which consists of reconstructed images using adaptive wavelet coder and JPEG. 
To start your research, the <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~gdavis/wavelet/wavelet.html">wavelet image compression construction kit</a> 
could help you a lot, which contains images, wavelet transform code, filter coefficients, and lots of 
other resources for wavelet compression.
For more wavelet coding related sites, you can find on the 
<a href="http://www-isl.stanford.edu/~gray/iii.html#wavecode">Signal Processing and the Multimedia Information Infrastructure</a>. 
Finally, we are sure that after the discovering of the complete Lenna story, we will enjoy our research more with the lovely Lenna picture.
